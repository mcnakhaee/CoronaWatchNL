\title{Get ICU patients data published by LCPS}
\usage{
get_lcps_data()
}
\value{
\describe{
\item{Datum/Date}{Date of notification}
\item{Land/Country}{Dutch COVID-19 cases were taken into the IC in either Germany (Duitsland) or the Netherlands (Nederland)}
\item{Aantal/Count}{Total number of IC intakes* in Germany, the Netherlands, and in total (sum of both countries) on the date of notification)}
}
}
\description{
These numbers are based on NICE data. However, to compensate for the reporting lag, LCPS tries to estimate the size of this lag and adds it to the numbers reported by NICE. LCPS data is, therefore, consistently higher than the 'totaalOpnamen' reported by NICE.
