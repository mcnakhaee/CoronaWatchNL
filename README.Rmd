CoronaWatchNL is an R package that allow you to have an up-to-date  access to a wide range range of Covid-19 related datasets in the Netherlands. This package is heavily based on the [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL) repository on GitHub which collects and releases this information on a daily basis. However, the R package also provides more datasets that are not included in the original repository, such as [the weekly mortality rate data](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/series/mortality-per-week) published by CBS () .

At the moment, the following category of datasets are available through this R package:

### Geographical datasets

These datasets are

## Installation

You can install the development version of CoronaWatchNL from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mcnakhaee/CoronaWatchNL")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(CoronaWatchNL)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
mortality_rate <- get_mortality_rate()
mortality_rate %>% 
  filter(Periods >'2019',!Periods %in% c('2019JJ00'),Sex == 'T001038',Age31December == 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = seq_along(Periods),y = Deaths_1)) +
  geom_line() +
  #scale_x_continuous(labels = )
  facet_grid( Age31December~Sex,scales = 'free_y') +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```
