CoronaWatchNL is an R package that allow you to have access to a wide range range of Covid-19 data in the Netherlands. This package mainly uses data that is collected and released by the CoronaWatchNL repository on Github. However, it also provides more datasets that are not included in that repository such, weekly mortality rate.

At the moment, the following category of datasets can be accessed via this package:






## Installation

You can install the development version of CoronaWatchNL from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mcnakhaee/CoronaWatchNL")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(CoronaWatchNL)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
